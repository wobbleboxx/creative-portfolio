    longDescription: `Ever wondered what would happen if you launched a pachinko machine into a synthwave black hole? You'd get Cosmic Plinko—an adrenaline-fueled arcade game that transforms the classic game of chance into a frantic test of skill, reflexes, and survival.

This isn't your grandma's Plinko. Take control of a high-energy orb and hurtle through an endless, procedurally generated cosmos. Your only tool for survival? A limited supply of powerful dashes. Smash through crimson energy gates, ricochet off reality-bending pegs, and navigate treacherous fields of bumpers, spinners, and gravity wells. Every descent is a unique, unpredictable gauntlet where one wrong move could send you into the void.

Can you handle the cosmic chaos?

Dash to Survive: Use your tactical dashes to break through barriers and steer through danger. But be warned—when you're out of dashes, it's game over.
An Ever-Changing Universe: With procedurally generated levels featuring shifting walls, dizzying funnels, and mind-bending portals, no two runs are ever the same.
Unleash Epic Power-ups: Grab collectibles to slow down time, transform into an unstoppable Power Ball, or trigger a chaotic multiball frenzy.
Face the Serpent: Plunge deep enough and you'll awaken the Cosmic Serpent—a colossal boss that will hunt you through the void. Do you have the skill to defeat it?
Mesmerizing Visuals: Immerse yourself in a vibrant, neon-drenched world with a retro-futuristic aesthetic that pulsates with every bounce.
Ready to test your mettle against the infinite? Sharpen your reflexes, manage your dashes, and see how deep you can go.`,
